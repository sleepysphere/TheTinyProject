\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Source code:} \url{https://github.com/dhtson/TinyProject} \\
        This repository contains the full implementation of the project, including all scripts, model definitions, and documentation. It serves as the primary reference for the codebase and project structure.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{train.py}:} A Python script for training the model, used for validation from the C++ code. \\
        This script handles data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It was referenced to ensure the C++ implementation produces consistent results with the original Python workflow.
    \item \textbf{External Libraries:} The project relies on several open-source libraries, such as NumPy, PyTorch, and OpenCV.
\end{itemize}
